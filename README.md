# New Sort Algorithm

This project demonstrates a custom sorting algorithm implemented in Java within a single file, `Main.java`. The algorithm sorts an array of integers in ascending order, tracking the number of times the `while` loop is executed during sorting.

## Project Structure

- **Main.java**: Contains the `newSort` method, which implements the sorting algorithm, as well as helper methods for printing and testing the sorting functionality.

## Features

- **Custom Sorting Algorithm**: Sorts an array of integers using a unique approach, swapping elements until the array is sorted in ascending order.
- **Loop Count Tracking**: Prints the number of iterations made in the `while` loop, providing insights into the algorithm's efficiency.
- **Example Data**: Tests the sorting method on sample arrays for demonstration.

## Methods

- **`newSort(int[] A)`**: Sorts the input array `A` in ascending order and prints the number of iterations in the main `while` loop.
- **`printArray(int[] A)`**: Helper method to format and print the contents of an array as a string.
